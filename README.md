This script is based on the work of tozes that can be found here: https://github.com/tozes/taranis_telemetry. I've reconfigured the layout and added a classic style RSSI bar graph.

To use this, put it on an SDcard in location SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/ and put it in the QX7. Then in the QX7 setup menu in the telemetry screens section, simply assign the script to one of your pages.
