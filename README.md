This script is based on the work of tozes that can be found here: https://github.com/tozes/taranis_telemetry. I've reconfigured the layout and added a classic style RSSI bar graph.

To use this, put it on an SDcard in location SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/ and put it in the QX7. Then in the QX7 setup menu in the telemetry screens section, simply assign the script to one of your pages.

This script is made for my model setup. Things to check for your setup:
-Battery setup on lines 42-46
-RSSI limits on lines 48-49
-Switch settings on lines 51-56
-Data sources lines 62-68
